# SFIBuddy App

SFIBuddy is a cross-platform language learning tool designed to assist immigrants in Sweden who are learning Swedish through SFI (Svenska för invandrare). 
As a recent immigrant myself, I found that learning Swedish as a beginner can be overwhelming due to the large number of unfamiliar words encountered in daily lessons. 
Manually writing down new words, translating them, and revising them later is time-consuming and often ineffective. 
To solve this problem, I decided to create a tool that can help both myself and fellow students in mastering Swedish vocabulary more efficiently.

## 🌟 Key Features

SFIBuddy is designed to make Swedish language learning more effective and efficient through the following core features:

### 📝 New Word Recording
- Use your phone to **take a photo of Swedish text from SFI materials**.
- The app utilizes **AI to automatically identify unfamiliar words** from the text and records them for you.

### 📚 Word Definitions
- Each recorded word is enriched with **definitions, word types, and grammatical forms**.
- The app provides **detailed explanations of nouns (plural, definite forms) and verbs (conjugations in different tenses)** to help learners fully understand each word.

### 🔔 Vocabulary Review
- The app uses a **spaced repetition system (SRS)** to remind users to review recorded words based on a scientifically proven memory curve.
- This feature ensures users are consistently exposed to new words, improving retention over time.
